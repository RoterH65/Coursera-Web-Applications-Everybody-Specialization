# Redirect, Routing, and Authentication
    ## HTTP Status Codes
        - 200 OK
        - 404 Not Found
        - 302 Found/Moved
    ## HTTP Location Header
        - If your application has not yet sent any data, it can send a special header as part of the HTTP Response.
        - The redirect header includes a URL that the browser is supposed to forward itself to

# Post / Redirect
    ## Post / Refresh / :(
        - Once you do a POST, if you fresh, the browser will re-send the Post data a second time
        - The user gets a pop-up that tries to explain what is about to happen
    ## No Double Posts
        - Typically POST requests are adding or modifying data whilst GET requests view data
        - It may be dangerous to do the same POST twice (say withdrawing funds from a bank account)    
        - So the browser insists on asking the user (out of your control)
        - Kind of an ugly UX / bad usability
    ## POST Redirect Rule 
        - The simple rule for pages intended for a browser is to never generate a page with HTML content
        when the app receives POST data.
        - Must redirect somewhere - even to the same script - forcing the browser to make a GET after the POST
        
# Implementing Login and Logout 
    ## Session / Authentication
        - Having a session is not the same as being logged in 
        - Generally you have a session the instant you connect to a web site 
        - The Session ID cookie is set when the first page is delivered
        - Login puts user information in the session (stored in the server)
        - Logout removes user information from the session

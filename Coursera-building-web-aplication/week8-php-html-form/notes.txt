# Using GET and POST with FORMS
    ## Rules of the POST/GET Choice
        - Post is used when data is being created or modified
        - Get is used when your are reading or searching things
        - Web search spiders will follow GET URLS but generally not POST URLS
        - Get URLS should be "idempotent" - the same URL should give the "same thing" each time you access it
        - Get has an upper limit of the number of bytes of parameters and values (think about 2K)
